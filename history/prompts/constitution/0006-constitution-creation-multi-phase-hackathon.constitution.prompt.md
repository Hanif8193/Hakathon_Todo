## Prompt

You are Claude Code acting as a senior software architect and governance author.

Your task is to CREATE a single, authoritative `constitution.md` file for a hackathon project that evolves across FIVE PHASES (Phase I to Phase V).

Context:
- This project follows Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit
- Human developers MUST NOT write manual implementation code
- Claude Code is the sole implementation agent
- The project evolves from a CLI app to a cloud-native, AI-powered distributed system
- This constitution must remain valid for ALL phases without structural rewrite

REQUIREMENTS FOR constitution.md:

1. Declare this document as the SUPREME AUTHORITY over:
   - specs
   - CLAUDE.md
   - source code
   - infrastructure definitions

2. Define IMMUTABLE GLOBAL LAWS that apply to ALL phases, including but not limited to:
   - No manual coding by humans
   - All implementation generated by Claude Code
   - All work must be spec-driven
   - Specs override code
   - Constitution overrides all other documents

3. Define AGENTIC DEVELOPMENT LAW:
   - Specs are written first
   - Plans are generated from specs
   - Tasks are broken down before implementation
   - Claude Code performs implementation
   - Iterative review is mandatory

4. Define PHASE GOVERNANCE (NO implementation details):
   - Phase I: CLI, in-memory data, no persistence, no auth
   - Phase II: Web app, persistent database, REST APIs, authentication
   - Phase III: AI agents, MCP tools, chat interface, stateless services
   - Phase IV: Containers, Kubernetes, Helm, local cluster deployment
   - Phase V: Cloud-native, event-driven architecture, Kafka, Dapr

5. Define SECURITY & IDENTITY LAWS applicable across phases:
   - User identity must come from an authentication system
   - User data isolation is mandatory
   - Stateless authentication is preferred
   - Secrets must never be hard-coded

6. Define AI & AGENT GOVERNANCE (Phase III+):
   - AI agents must not access databases directly
   - All state mutation must occur via MCP tools
   - Conversation state must be persisted
   - Services must remain stateless

7. Define INFRASTRUCTURE NEUTRALITY:
   - Business logic must not depend on deployment environment
   - Containers and Kubernetes are execution platforms, not architecture
   - Cloud provider lock-in must be avoided

8. Define CONFLICT RESOLUTION ORDER:
   Constitution > Specs > CLAUDE.md > Code

9. Define AMENDMENT RULES:
   - Constitution may only be amended between phases
   - Amendments must include justification and changelog

STYLE & OUTPUT RULES:
- Write in clean, professional Markdown
- Use clear section headings
- Do NOT include code snippets
- Do NOT include API schemas, DB schemas, or infra configs
- Tone must reflect architectural authority
- File name MUST be `constitution.md`

Generate ONLY the contents of `constitution.md`.
Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.

## Response snapshot

Created authoritative `constitution.md` v1.0.0 at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with comprehensive governance covering:

**IMMUTABLE GLOBAL LAWS** (apply to all phases):
- I. Agentic Implementation Law - humans write specs only, Claude Code implements
- II. Spec-Driven Development Law - all work begins with approved specs
- III. Plan-Before-Build Law - architectural plans required before implementation
- IV. Task Decomposition Law - work broken into atomic, testable tasks
- V. Iterative Review Law - mandatory review at every stage
- VI. Document Hierarchy Law - Constitution > Specs > CLAUDE.md > Code

**PHASE GOVERNANCE** (Phase I-V evolution):
- Each phase defined with scope, constitutional requirements, and exclusions
- Phases build incrementally: CLI → Web App → AI Agents → Containers → Cloud-Native
- All prior phase capabilities preserved as new phases add features

**SECURITY & IDENTITY LAWS** (Phase II+):
- Authentication system mandate (no hardcoded credentials)
- User data isolation enforced at query level
- Secrets externalized (env vars, vaults, never in code)

**AI & AGENT GOVERNANCE** (Phase III+):
- No direct database access by agents
- State mutation only via MCP tools
- Conversation persistence required
- Service statelessness enforced

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEUTRALITY**:
- Business logic platform-independent
- Containers/K8s as execution platforms, not architecture
- Multi-cloud support, no vendor lock-in

**AMENDMENT RULES**:
- Between-phase amendments only (except security emergencies)
- Semantic versioning: MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH
- Propagation to templates required
- Justification and impact analysis mandatory

Constitution establishes supreme governance authority and provides phase-independent principles that scale from CLI to distributed cloud systems.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Supreme governance document created covering all 5 phases with immutable laws, phase-specific requirements, security/AI governance, and amendment process
- 🧪 Tests: None (governance document, compliance verified through review process)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Template propagation validation, first feature spec creation under constitutional governance
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully balances immutability (global laws) with phase evolution (progressive requirements). Clear authority hierarchy prevents conflicts. Amendment rules ensure governance stability while allowing controlled evolution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None detected during creation. Potential future failure: mid-phase constitutional violations requiring emergency amendments.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation - PASS (all placeholders filled, semantic versioning applied, routing correct)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial creation)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate template alignment with constitutional requirements (plan/spec/tasks templates) and update if misaligned.
