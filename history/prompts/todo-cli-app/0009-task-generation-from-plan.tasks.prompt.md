## Prompt

//sp.tasks --from plan

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown (tasks.md) with 35 atomic, independently testable tasks organized by user story and phase.

**Task Organization**:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T004) - 4 tasks
   - Project structure creation
   - UV configuration
   - Git ignore
   - Package initialization

2. **Phase 2: Foundation** (T005-T012) - 8 tasks
   - Todo dataclass entity
   - Storage layer (dict + CRUD functions)
   - All foundational operations (add, get, update, delete, mark_complete)
   - BLOCKS all user story work

3. **Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add and View** (T013-T021) - 9 tasks ⭐ MVP
   - Operations layer (add_new_todo, view_all_todos)
   - CLI display functions
   - Menu system
   - Main loop
   - Entry point
   - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE OTHER STORIES

4. **Phase 4: User Story 2 - Mark Complete** (T022-T024) - 3 tasks
   - Toggle status operation
   - CLI handler
   - Display enhancement for status distinction

5. **Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update Details** (T025-T026) - 2 tasks
   - Update operation with validation
   - CLI update handler

6. **Phase 6: User Story 4 - Delete** (T027-T028) - 2 tasks
   - Remove operation
   - CLI delete handler

7. **Phase 7: Polish & Documentation** (T029-T035) - 7 tasks
   - README.md
   - Error handling enhancements
   - Manual test suite execution
   - 100+ todo capacity test
   - 20+ operations test

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **Bottom-Up Implementation**: Data model → Storage → Operations → CLI → Entry point
- **MVP-First**: User Story 1 must complete before other stories (establishes foundation)
- **Independent User Stories**: US2, US3, US4 can run in parallel after US1
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task independently testable with explicit acceptance criteria
- **Clear Dependencies**: Foundation blocks all stories; US1 blocks US2/US3/US4

**Dependency Structure**:
```
Setup (T001-T004)
  ↓
Foundation (T005-T012) ← CRITICAL BLOCKER
  ↓
User Story 1 (T013-T021) ← MVP BLOCKER
  ↓
  ├─→ User Story 2 (T022-T024)
  ├─→ User Story 3 (T025-T026)
  └─→ User Story 4 (T027-T028)
       ↓
Polish (T029-T035)
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Setup: T003, T004 parallel after T001-T002
- Foundation: T008-T012 parallel after T005-T007
- User Story 1: T013+T014 parallel, T018+T019 parallel
- User Stories 2-4: All three can work in parallel after US1
- Polish: T029-T032 all parallel

**Acceptance Criteria Highlights**:
- Every task has explicit, measurable acceptance criteria
- Manual test procedures defined for each user story
- Constitutional compliance verification at phase boundaries
- No crashes, graceful error handling required throughout

**Manual Testing Strategy**:
- User Story 1: Add 3 todos, view list, verify IDs/details
- User Story 2: Mark todos complete, verify status changes
- User Story 3: Update title/description, verify changes persist
- User Story 4: Delete todos, verify removal and error handling
- Edge cases: Empty titles, invalid IDs, 100+ todos, 20+ operations

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- All tasks implement Phase I requirements (CLI, in-memory, no persistence, no auth)
- No external dependencies (standard library only)
- All code generated by Claude Code
- Atomic and independently testable
- Explicit acceptance criteria per task

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve tasks.md
2. Execute `/sp.implement` to begin Claude Code implementation
3. Implement sequentially: Setup → Foundation → US1 → US2/3/4 → Polish
4. Stop after each phase for validation
5. Execute manual tests at user story boundaries

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 35 atomic tasks generated, organized by user story, with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing procedures defined for all user stories and edge cases
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Task approval, then /sp.implement for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully translates plan into executable units. MVP-first approach ensures incremental delivery. Clear dependencies prevent blocking work. Parallel opportunities identified for efficiency.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during task generation. Potential future failure: task acceptance criteria may need refinement during implementation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation - PASS (all tasks atomic, independently testable, constitutional compliance verified)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial task generation)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute /sp.implement and monitor if task breakdown is sufficient or requires adjustment during implementation.
