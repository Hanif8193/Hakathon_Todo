## Prompt

/sp.spcify  # Phase I Specification
## Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

---

## 1. Phase Identity

**Phase:** I
**Phase Name:** Todo In-Memory Python Console App
**Maturity Level:** Basic
**Governed By:** constitution.md

This specification defines the complete functional and non-functional requirements for Phase I of the project.

---

## 2. Objective

Build a command-line based Todo application that:

- Runs entirely in the console
- Stores all data in memory (no persistence)
- Is implemented exclusively by Claude Code
- Follows Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit Plus
- Demonstrates the Agentic Dev Stack workflow

---

## 3. Development Constraints

The following constraints are mandatory:

- No manual code may be written by a human
- All implementation must be generated by Claude Code
- Development must follow:
  1. Specification
  2. Plan generation
  3. Task decomposition
  4. Implementation
  5. Review and iteration
- No features outside this specification are allowed

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

The application MUST support the following five basic features:

### 4.1 Add Todo
- Allow the user to add a new todo item
- Each todo must include:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
- Each todo must receive a unique identifier

### 4.2 View Todos
- Display a list of all todos
- Each todo must show:
  - ID
  - Title
  - Completion status (complete / incomplete)

### 4.3 Update Todo
- Allow updating:
  - Title
  - Description
- Updates must target a todo by its ID

### 4.4 Delete Todo
- Allow deletion of a todo by ID
- Deleted todos must be removed from memory

### 4.5 Mark Todo Complete / Incomplete
- Allow toggling the completion status of a todo
- Status changes must be immediately reflected in the list view

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- The application must run entirely in the terminal
- Data must be stored in memory only
- No database, file storage, or external services are allowed
- The application must be deterministic and predictable
- Code must follow clean structure and readability standards

---

## 6. User Interaction Requirements

- The user must interact via command-line prompts
- Clear instructions must be shown for each action
- Errors (such as invalid IDs) must be handled gracefully
- The user must be able to perform multiple actions in one session

---

## 7. Technical Stack

The implementation must use the following technologies:

- Python 3.13 or higher
- UV for environment and dependency management
- Claude Code for all code generation
- Spec-Kit Plus for specification governance

No additional technologies are permitted in Phase I.

---

## 8. Project Structure Requirements

The repository must contain:

- `constitution.md`
- `specs/`
  - `history/` containing all previous specification versions
- `src/` containing Python source code
- `README.md` with setup and usage instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` defining Claude Code operating rules

---

## 9. Out of Scope (Explicitly Forbidden)

The following are NOT allowed in Phase I:

- Databases
- File-based persistence
- Web interfaces
- Authentication or authorization
- AI agents or MCP tools
- Containers or cloud infrastructure

---

## 10. Completion Criteria

Phase I is considered complete when:

- All five basic todo features are implemented
- The application runs successfully in the console
- All constraints defined in this specification are satisfied
- The implementation is fully generated by Claude Code
- The repository structure matches the defined requirements

---

## 11. Amendment Policy

This specification may only be modified:

- Before starting implementation
- Or at the transition to the next phase

All changes must be recorded in `specs/history/`.

---

End of Phase I Specification

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Phase I specification at `specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md` following Spec-Kit Plus template with full constitutional compliance.

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- ✅ All 6 Immutable Global Laws referenced with checkboxes
- ✅ Phase I requirements explicitly verified (CLI-only, in-memory, no persistence, no auth)
- ✅ Compliance sections for Security/AI/Infrastructure included (marked N/A for Phase I)

**Specification Structure**:

1. **User Stories** (4 stories, prioritized P1-P4):
   - P1: Add and View Todos (MVP - independently testable)
   - P2: Mark Todos Complete (builds on P1)
   - P3: Update Todo Details (useful but not critical)
   - P4: Delete Todos (nice to have for cleanup)
   - Each story includes: priority rationale, independent test description, acceptance scenarios

2. **Requirements**:
   - 14 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-014)
   - Key Entity: Todo (ID, Title, Description, Status)

3. **Success Criteria**:
   - 8 measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-008)
   - Performance: 100 todos, 20+ operations per session

4. **Constraints**:
   - Development Constraints: Agentic implementation, spec-driven workflow
   - Technical Constraints: Python 3.13+, UV, no persistence, console-only
   - Phase I Architectural Constraints: No auth, no AI, no containers

5. **Exclusions**:
   - 10 explicit forbidden items (databases, files, web, auth, AI, containers, cloud, events, external libs)

6. **Project Structure**: Defined repository layout with .specify/, specs/, src/, tests/

7. **Amendment Policy**: Before implementation or at phase transition only

**Next Steps**:
1. Await specification approval
2. Execute `/sp.plan` to generate architectural plan
3. Execute `/sp.tasks` to generate task breakdown
4. Execute `/sp.implement` to begin implementation

Specification follows constitutional mandate for spec-driven development and establishes clear boundaries for Phase I scope.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Phase I specification created with constitutional compliance, prioritized user stories, and clear boundaries
- 🧪 Tests: None (specification document - implementation testing defined in acceptance scenarios)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Specification approval, then /sp.plan for architectural planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances detail with clarity. User stories are independently testable and prioritized for incremental delivery. Constitutional compliance ensures governance from the start. Clear exclusions prevent scope creep.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during creation. Potential future failure: scope creep during implementation without referring back to exclusions.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation - PASS (all constitutional requirements met, user stories independently testable, requirements traceable)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial specification)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute /sp.plan to validate that architectural planning can successfully operate on this specification structure.
